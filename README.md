#### Summary

This week you will be producing a web application as a team, due by 2:00 pm on Friday, and then presenting your work for the rest of SWE Launch and the Full Time staff on Friday. This application will use all of the skills we have learned so far, as well as some new skills we will cover this week. The presentation will be professional and well practiced. 
Scenario

Thomas Jefferson Elementary is currently a bit old-fashioned. They have been keeping track of their classes, rosters, grades, etc. entirely with paper records up until this point... they have not adapted to the times. But they are growing tired of continually making copies of things, losing critical information from misplacing documents, and all the other issues that come from managing hundreds of children with only paper. You and your group are a team of professional web developers who were recommended to the school for your web development prowess, and have been hired to help create some sort of web application to manage the school’s previously paper-bound information. The school administrators are unfamiliar with web development and React, but they have provided general guidance on the types of information and the functionality that they want out of a web application. Your task is to take the guidance and needs of the elementary school and develop a killer web application dashboard for the school and its administrators. Help bring TJ Elementary into the digital age! 

### Timeline

The school really wants the web application… they asked your team to complete it by 2:00 pm on Friday. Even though it is a quick turnaround they are confident in your web dev skills and are excited to see the final product. 
Details

Using React, create a single page application for Thomas Jefferson Elementary School. They have requested an administrative dashboard that will let the staff manage student enrollment in classes (enroll, assign class and teacher, basic information of the student), as well as keep track of basic information about the school and its students. Use Firebase to keep track of the different people (student, admin, teacher) and what class the teachers and students are assigned, as well events that are going on at the school. 

### Requirements
* Pages
* Home page that allows you to view the various features of the web app and navigate to them
* Overall dashboard of all classes 
* Class page that includes average grade among other information about the class, including the roster
* Teacher dashboard that allows them to add grades to students (can be combined with the class page)
* Student directory
* Teacher directory
* School calendar to view all school events


### Functionality 
* Ability to Create/Read/Update/Delete Students, Teachers, Classes and School Events
* Ability to add and remove students and teachers from class rosters
* Ability to edit grade of certain students in certain rosters
* Store these items in Firebase

### Design
* Professional and appealing design. This should be as if a real school is using it, or as close to it as possible. 
* Take into consideration basic UI principles (should not get trapped on a page without being able to navigate off of it, button labels should be unambiguous, etc.)

* Hint on the database objects you will need for these requirements: You will keep track of students and their basic information (name, birthday, etc.), teachers and their basic information, classes and which students are enrolled in them/what teachers are teaching them. You will also keep track of the school’s events for the school calendar. 

Part of this assignment is thinking about how to structure your database and what type of information you will need to store to meet the needs of the school. 

### Github 
In your github repository we highly recommend that you put into practice feature based branching to organize your repository. This will help you keep your code organized and avoid team members working on the same branch and causing conflicts.

Use a Pull Request once the feature is complete to merge back into the main branch. Details of the strategy are covered in the hyperlinked tutorial. Try to minimize the amount that team members are working on the same files or the same areas of code on different computers because that will quickly lead to many merge conflicts upon PR, which are no fun at all.
